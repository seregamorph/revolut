Test task
=================

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money transfers
between internal users/accounts.
Explicit requirements:

* keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is invoked by another internal system/service)
* use whatever frameworks/libraries you like (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the requirement #1
* the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test
* the final result should be executable as a standalone Java program
* demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected

Implicit requirements:
* the code produced by you is expected to be of good quality.
* there are no detailed requirements, use common sense.

Please put your work on github or bitbucket.
